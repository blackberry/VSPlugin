Start Guide
===========

  Unless Momentics (or any previous version of this plugin) was used before, few extra
MANUAL steps have to be made before this package works smoothly without errors and warnings.

1) Ensure BlackBerry Native SDK (NDK) is installed. It can be any available edition (distributed directly by
   BlackBerry as MSI installer, or using Momentics, or as BBNDK_VS - compacted NDK skeleton - available as
   separate part of this plugin at https://github.com/phofman/vs-plugin/releases/tag/v3.0.1-bbndk, allowing
   downloads of new NDKs automatically), although the last option is preferred as it enables UI to manipulate
   NDKs inside Visual Studio.

2) Ensure MSBuild extensions (also distributed separately at https://github.com/phofman/vs-plugin/releases/latest)
   has been copied into "C:\Program Files (x86)\MSBuild".
   Without them it won't be possible to create new project, compile and deploy applications.

In case of any problems, please visit the wiki pages at https://github.com/phofman/vs-plugin/wiki/Installation
or https://github.com/phofman/vs-plugin/wiki/ for general details and documentation.


Also note, that the plugin doesn't spy on you. It doesn't collect any usage statistics, nor send any crash-reports.
Then if you want anything fixed or imporved visit the project page at https://github.com/phofman/vs-plugin/.
